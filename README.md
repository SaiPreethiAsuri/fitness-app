### GitHub Actions CI/CD Overview
This project includes a GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml) that runs automatically on every push to any branch.
**The pipeline performs the following steps:**
Checkout the repository
Uses actions/checkout@v3 to fetch the latest code.
Set up Docker Buildx
Configures Docker for building images in the CI environment.
Build Docker image
Creates a container image named my-flask-app:ci with all dependencies and source code.
Run unit tests inside the container
Executes Pytest to verify the application functionality and stability.

The workflow ensures that every code change is automatically tested and validated in a containerized environment before deployment.
This setup ensures you can run, test, and containerize the application both locally and via CI/CD.
